todo goal for weekend: playable thing
    clear all timeouts on off
    highlight response note
    match reset button
    install modal
        data structure for messaging
    compose some drone pitches in Ableton!
    prevent double-tap on correct note from causing a miss

    basic leveling system
        just get through major (and play it) a bunch before moving on to minor
            because: need to define advancement rhythm, code, test this whole concept
            reset count option
    look over those variable names, yipe. need to refactor before going any further.


PONDERING
    timing: maybe have some sort of averaging system for playback time?
        like it averages the last x notes

    leveling: how do you really know when you've learned it?

    re: newLevelNoteMatches
        might want that to change for each note set.
            a case for a larger scale/level data structure?

    what happens if it plays a note, then you play the wrong note,
        then play right right note (before it responds?)
            previous timeout is cleared, new one set from the noteCalledTime
                got a problem with that?

DEV QUESTIONS
    store progress data with scale data?




TUTORIAL / NOTIFICATIONS
    (skip tutorial option)
    One note start - flash the button.
        Text indicates you to set the rhythm (test for rhythm?)
    Two notes
        First flash the buttons.
        Once a few are done, remove flash and show match and miss
            & Show 'training wheels' option
            Text re: only track matches w/o training wheels
    Unlock Minor 3rd


FEATURES
    modal overlay for level advance (display unlocked, stats, etc.)
    drone pitches in background
        turn-off-able
    more sophisticated leveling: steady tempo requirement, tempo minimums (how to do tempo averaging?)
    track timing average at level
    persistence
        once you got your data structure figured out...
    mode-switching options
    some way to track progress to next level
    display BPM as goes (tempo averaging?)
        use a dial rather than displaying a number
    flash starting pitch
        "training wheels" option
            always play root first; always flash first note
            flash every pitch (how to limit re:
            (how to limit re: advancement and scoring?)
    timing minimums

    ROOT NOTE SYSTEM
        this is how you manage expressions that go below the root
            without messing up/over-complicating the 13-note system
        play drone pitch in background
            & style on 'root' note with different background
        root starts on C, but can change
            after major scale is complete, root can go up the scale to outline modes
            after you've unlocked all those roots, the root will change randomly


            <select className="select-scale" onChange={() => {console.log('changing scale')}}>
              <option>Major</option><option>Minor</option>
            </select>
            <select>
              <option>2</option> <option>3</option> <option>4</option> <option>5</option> <option>6</option> <option>7</option> <option>8</option>
            </select>

    ... this will have to come from experience
        maybe find some music profs to discuss


LATER ("Premium")
    advanced scales beyond diatonic
    scoop
    multi-note expressions
    match/miss splash
        different speed for apply/remove styles?
        other sorts of animations? confetti?
