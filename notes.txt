    compare timeouts with Seo's debounce

todo next dev
    basic leveling system
        need a getter for, like, currentScaleAndLevelMatchCount
            and look over those variable names, yipe. need to refactor before going any further.
            reduce file size
                move styles to css
                move levelTracking to it's own file
        define scales in arrays and filter the number of elements per level
        each scale tracks own level
        advancement at: minMatchCount && match/missRatio
            more sophisticated: steady tempo requirement, tempo minimums (how to do tempo averaging?)
        scales shown but greyed out in the UI until unlocked
    key listeners
    ? debounce to prevent multiple responses from messing up the timeouts
