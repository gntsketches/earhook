todo goal for weekend: playable thing
    need to play each new type of pitch at least _x_ times
    what happens if it plays a note, then you play the wrong note,
        then play right right note (before it responds?)
    basic leveling system
        just get through major (and play it) a bunch before moving on to minor
            because: need to define advancement rhythm, code, test this whole concept
        advancement at:
            minMatchCount && match/missRatio
            reset count option
        install modal
    look over those variable names, yipe. need to refactor before going any further.

    timing: maybe have some sort of averaging system for playback time?
        like it averages the last x notes

    reduce file size
        move levelTracking to it's own file
        components for:
    review renders

DEV QUESTIONS
    store progress data with scale data?




TUTORIAL / NOTIFICATIONS
    (skip tutorial option)
    One note start - flash the button.
        Text indicates you to set the rhythm (test for rhythm?)

    callNote repeat limit (not more than say 4 Cs in a row)
    auto-off (after say 4 dead notes)
    more sophisticated leveling: steady tempo requirement, tempo minimums (how to do tempo averaging?)
    track timing average at level
    persistence
    mode-switching options

    display BPM as goes (tempo averaging?)
    flash starting pitch

            (how to limit re: advancement and scoring?)
    timing minimums

    ROOT NOTE SYSTEM
        this is how you manage expressions that go below the root
            without messing up/over-complicating the 13-note system
        play drone pitch in background
            & style on 'root' note with different background
        root starts on C, but can change
            after major scale is complete, root can go up the scale to outline modes
            after you've unlocked all those roots, the root will change randomly


            <select className="select-scale" onChange={() => {console.log('changing scale')}}>
              <option>Major</option><option>Minor</option>
            </select>
            <select>
              <option>2</option> <option>3</option> <option>4</option> <option>5</option> <option>6</option> <option>7</option> <option>8</option>
            </select>
